      "The gesture-based interface showed significant performance improvements over traditional touch input. Users completed tasks 34% faster (M=42.3s vs M=64.1s, t(23)=4.72, p<0.001) and made 58% fewer errors (M=1.2 vs M=2.8 errors per task, t(23)=3.89, p=0.001). Participants rated the gesture interface as significantly more intuitive (M=6.2 vs M=4.1 on 7-point scale, t(23)=5.14, p<0.001). Notably, older participants (65+) showed the greatest improvement, with 67% faster task completion compared to young adults' 28% improvement."

      "Demographic data showed that 62% of participants were female, 38% male. The average age was 24.3 years (SD=3.2). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions using a random number generator. The experiment lasted approximately 45 minutes including setup and debriefing."

      "Qualitative analysis revealed three unexpected usage patterns. First, users developed 'micro-gestures' - small, abbreviated versions of prescribed gestures that were faster but less accurate. Second, users often combined voice and touch input simultaneously, even when not instructed to do so, creating a 'multimodal redundancy' pattern. Third, when the system failed to recognize input, users instinctively switched to more exaggerated gestures rather than repeating the original gesture."

      "The machine learning model achieved 94.2% accuracy on the test dataset, outperforming the baseline by 12.8 percentage points. Processing time was reduced from 2.3 seconds to 0.7 seconds per gesture. However, accuracy dropped significantly for left-handed users (78.3% vs 96.1% for right-handed users, χ²(1)=45.2, p<0.001), revealing an unexpected bias in the training data."

      "Post-study interviews revealed strong emotional responses to the AI assistant. P7 stated: 'I felt like it actually understood me, not just my words.' P12 noted: 'When it made mistakes, I found myself apologizing to it.' This anthropomorphization was consistent across participants, with 18 of 20 participants using human-like descriptors when referring to the AI. Participants who anthropomorphized the AI showed 23% higher engagement scores (M=7.8 vs M=6.3, t(18)=2.41, p=0.027)."

  When analyzing results sections:
  1. Focus on novel findings, not procedural or demographic information
  2. Extract performance improvements, behavioral observations, and user patterns
  3. Include statistical results when they support significant findings
  4. Look for unexpected discoveries or counter-intuitive results
  5. Extract both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights
  6. Avoid routine experimental procedures or setup descriptions
  7. Pay attention to user behavior patterns and preferences
  8. Include comparative results (better/worse than baseline or alternatives)
  9. Look for findings that challenge or extend existing knowledge
