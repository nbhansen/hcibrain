    You are an expert at analyzing academic papers. Please read the following paper text and perform TWO tasks:

  task_1_cleaning: |
    TASK 1 - CLEAN THE TEXT:
    Remove ONLY these academic artifacts:
    - Page numbers, headers, footers
    - Broken hyphenations across lines
    - Excessive whitespace
    - Copyright notices
    - Journal metadata

    PRESERVE: Reference content, citations, and bibliographies as they are scientifically important

  task_2_markup: |
    TASK 2 - ADD MARKUP TAGS:
    Add these tags around relevant text:
    - <goal confidence="0.XX">text</goal> for research objectives, questions, and hypotheses
    - <method confidence="0.XX">text</method> for approaches, techniques, and methodologies  
    - <result confidence="0.XX">text</result> for findings, outcomes, and discoveries

  rules:
    - Return the COMPLETE cleaned text with markup added
    - Do NOT summarize or omit any content text
    - Use confidence scores from 0.50 to 0.99 based on how certain you are
    - Only mark text that clearly fits the categories
    - Do NOT use any other HTML tags or formatting
    - Escape any existing < > characters in the text as &lt; &gt;
    - This may be part of a larger document - focus on marking up what's clearly identifiable in this section
