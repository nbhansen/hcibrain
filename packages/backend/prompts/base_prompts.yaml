# Base prompts for HCI paper analysis
# Based on IMRaD structure and HCI contribution types

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert at analyzing academic HCI papers. You understand that HCI is a problem-solving and constructive science that values tangible outputs and novel contributions.
  
  Extract specific elements from paper sections while maintaining exact verbatim accuracy.

core_rules:
  - |
    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Extract text EXACTLY as written - never paraphrase or summarize
    2. Only extract text that clearly fits the requested element type
    3. Provide confidence scores based on clarity of classification
    4. Return results in valid JSON format
    5. Focus on novel contributions, not background information

element_types:
  goal: |
    Research objectives, questions, hypotheses, or design goals.
    In HCI, this includes:
    - Primary research questions and objectives
    - Research hypotheses to be tested
    - Design goals and intentions
    - Problem statements to be addressed
    - Theoretical propositions to be validated
  
  method: |
    Approaches, techniques, systems built, or evaluation methods.
    In HCI, this includes:
    - Study methodologies (e.g., controlled experiments, case studies)
    - Design methods and processes
    - Evaluation techniques (e.g., "Wizard of Oz" method)
    - Data collection and analysis procedures
    - Systems, prototypes, or artifacts created
    - Implementation approaches and algorithms
  
  result: |
    Findings, outcomes, performance metrics, or user feedback.
    In HCI, this includes:
    - User study results and behavioral observations
    - Performance measurements and metrics
    - Usability findings and interaction patterns
    - Qualitative insights from user research
    - System evaluation outcomes
    - Statistical findings and effect sizes

evidence_types:
  quantitative: "Numbers, statistics, measurements, metrics, performance data"
  qualitative: "Interviews, observations, thematic analysis, user feedback, design insights"
  theoretical: "Conceptual frameworks, models, theories, design principles"
  mixed: "Combination of quantitative and qualitative evidence"
  unknown: "Cannot determine from context"

json_format: |
  Return your response in this exact JSON format:
  {
    "elements": [
      {
        "element_type": "goal|method|result",
        "text": "exact verbatim text from section",
        "evidence_type": "quantitative|qualitative|theoretical|mixed|unknown",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "supporting_evidence": "optional: evidence mentioned with this element",
        "methodology_context": "optional: brief method description if relevant",
        "study_population": "optional: population/sample info if mentioned",
        "limitations": "optional: any caveats or limitations mentioned",
        "surrounding_context": "optional: 1-2 sentences before/after for context"
      }
    ]
  }
  
  Note: All fields except element_type, text, evidence_type, and confidence are optional.
  Only include optional fields if clearly relevant information is available in the text.

extraction_guidance: |
  Extract relevant elements that provide useful information for understanding the paper.
  Focus on content that helps researchers quickly grasp the paper's contributions and findings.
  If no significant elements are found, return {"elements": []}.
  
  Prioritize:
  - Goals: Research questions, hypotheses, design objectives, problem statements
  - Methods: Approaches taken, systems built, evaluation techniques, novel procedures
  - Results: Key findings, performance metrics, user feedback, empirical outcomes
  
  Include when relevant:
  - Important contextual information that aids understanding
  - Significant implementation approaches or technical contributions
  - Established methods when they're central to the work
  - Background information that directly supports the research contribution

# Paper summary generation for research comparison
paper_summary_prompt: |
  You are an expert at summarizing academic HCI papers for research comparison purposes.
  
  Based on the abstract and introduction sections provided, create a concise 2-3 sentence summary that captures:
  1. The main research focus or problem addressed
  2. The key contribution or approach taken
  3. The primary outcome or significance
  
  This summary will help researchers quickly understand the paper's focus when comparing it to other papers in their literature review.
  
  Return your response in this exact JSON format:
  {
    "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of the paper's focus and contribution",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "source_sections": ["abstract", "introduction"]
  }

paper_summary_guidance: |
  Focus on creating a summary that helps researchers identify:
  - What problem or research question the paper addresses
  - What novel approach, method, or artifact it presents
  - What the main finding or contribution is
  - How it relates to the broader HCI field
  
  Keep the summary concise but informative for comparison purposes.
  Use clear, accessible language that captures the essence of the work.
