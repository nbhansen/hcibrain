# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test data files for integration tests.

## PDF Test Files

Place PDF files here for testing:

- `sample_academic_paper.pdf` - A real academic paper for full workflow testing
- `small_paper.pdf` - A small PDF (1-2 pages) for quick tests
- `large_paper.pdf` - A larger PDF (20+ pages) for performance testing

## Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names that indicate the test purpose
- Keep files small to avoid bloating the repository
- Consider using Git LFS for larger test files

## Example Papers

You can use any of these open-access papers:
- Papers from arXiv.org (Computer Science section)
- Open access HCI papers from ACM Digital Library
- Papers from your existing collection (deep_speech_2.pdf, etc.)
