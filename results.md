   - *Confidence:* 0.80

5. **Our search includes 01/01/2010-26/05/2023. The initial corpus of papers was 4499, and our search and filtering strategy unfolded in four phases:**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* quantitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

6. **To obtain these keywords, one author created a Python script that counted keyword frequency from the corpus after the phase 1 filtering removed irrelevant papers (e.g., false positives, duplicates, or concerning children).**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

7. **Keywords expected due to the nature of the study were removed (e.g. ASD, autism, autistic adult). However, keywords that included autism but referred to a topic of focus remained (e.g. autism diagnosis, autism classification).**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

8. **Once filtered, one author manually categorised keywords relating to a) technologies and b) topics.**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

9. **For instance, keywords such as autism spectrum disorder classification and autism trait classification were grouped to create a single topic category of Autism Classification.**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

10. **These categories were reviewed by another author.**

   - *Confidence:* 0.95

17. **Conencting through Kinect employed this quite creatively by encouraging movement in the design process, which was directly tailored to autistic needs.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

18. **We learn that the conflicting sensory needs of autistic people need to be considered particularly in group activities (e.g., in PIUMA and Biomusic).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

19. **All people, but especially autistic people, report differences in how they process sensory information, such as sounds [13].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

20. **Some people have low thresholds, meaning they are highly sensitive to the stimulus and desire to avoid them.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

21. **Others may have a high threshold and actively seek certain sensory stimuli.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

22. **These differences can cause tension and power imbalance, particularly in cases where it may seem that one stakeholder’s needs are prioritised over another.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

23. **Power dynamics played a nuanced role in facilitating conversations between autistic and non-autistic stakeholders [57, 59].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

24. **Three of the projects (AccessASD, AHAT, and Reimagining Social Media) mentioned having autistic researchers on the team, who were imperative for making decisions on the project direction and making connections with other autistic stakeholders, which has been recommended as a means for empowering autistic participation [62].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

25. **How activities were structured seemed to be important to ensure that participants had a voice.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

26. **Some projects approached this by ensuring that autistic stakeholders had an opportunity to share ideas individually before engaging in group activities (e.g., in AccessASD and SocialMirror), while others facilitated turn-taking (e.g., in PIUMA).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

27. **However, while these researchers have done great work, we also witnessed limited engagement of the autistic adult stakeholders in shaping and refining the approaches employed for participation.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

28. **The introduction of individual activities before group activities occurred was important in AccessASD and SocialMirror.**

   - *Confidence:* 0.95

29. **The level of participatory relationships varied between projects.**
   - *Section:* discussion

30. **However, few initiated from long-lasting relationships, with most focusing on a shorter period of time.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

31. **This is not surprising, given the limited resources available to support neurodiversity-affirmative research in autism [66].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

32. **Our analysis suggests that there is not a “one size fits all” solution, but rather an approach that is revisited and refined for future work following reflections between autistic and non-autistic stakeholders.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

   - *Evidence Type:* unknown
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

2. **There has been increasing interest in supporting autistic adults with technology (for example, at home [68, 87] or at work [35, 82]).**
   - *Section:* introduction
   - *Evidence Type:* unknown
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

3. **framing the problem from within the autistic person has been seen as harmful; it promotes a perception that autistic people must change their behaviour and adapt to the context**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

4. **they assume that there is an ideal mind to be attained**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

5. **We argue that more work is needed to reflect on decision-making on who participates, as well as assumptions that may influence those decisions.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

6. **It is important to consider how the nuances of how autistic stakeholders experience the world can be factored in designing activities, particularly in cases where there may be conflicts in sensory needs, such as in group activities (as referenced by Maun et al. [52]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

7. **Just as autistic adults are experts on what tools and technologies would benefit their lives, they are also experts on what methods and approaches could engage and drive them to participate.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

8. **Therefore, we believe there could be more opportunities to involve autistic people in the decision-making of methods employed through active reflection, as we will discuss in section 6.2.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

9. **Additionally, the projects demonstrated that balancing power is a principle that should be considered when evaluating how the project unfolds.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

10. **Although balancing such power is generally important in participatory projects [41, 76], the reflections on why this was facilitated seemed to stem from a consideration toward the voice of autistics in design and keeping the process autistic-centred.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

11. **Creating lasting impact is a key issue facing much of HCI research that engages communities (see e.g. [23, 42]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

12. **As researchers, we should connect with autistic-led organisations if the mechanism is to respect the autistic experience [31].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

13. **Embedding this research into the community enables “infrastructuring” [47], strengthening existing positive efforts by embedding them into the fabric of what is already there, strengthening impact, and increasing the possibility of long-term engagements.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

14. **In saying that, we argue the need to make visible the immediate gains that autistic people can harness through participation (which is important in community-based participatory design [48]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

15. **Doing so will also need to consider the plurality of goals between autistic stakeholders and organisational objectives, and how they align with the communities where participation is sought [48].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

16. **It is important to acknowledge that resources and funding may impact who is involved and how participation is facilitated.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

17. **As an example including autistic individuals, most Large Language Models may be trained to support the non-autistic rather than the autistic experience (e.g., Begel et al. [9]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

18. **In our keyword analysis, there appeared to be a strong correlation between papers containing keywords Autism Diagnosis, and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence - yet we found no participatory research concerning this topic in our corpus.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

19. **We suggest that more participatory design projects could include autistic people in conversations about the role AI (e.g. Large Language Models employed in chatbots/agents, or deep learning techniques employed for autism diagnosis) could play in their lives.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

20. **Additionally, we suggest conducting participatory research with autistic people to explore what the diagnostic process could look like and how technology could support that process.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

21. **With the growing recognition of self-diagnosis in neurodiversity-affirmative research (e.g., as indicated by Sarrett[73]), we recommend involving those who self-identify as autistic and how their needs could be facilitated in the diagnosis process, if at all.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

22. **We agree with Fletcher-Watson et al. [30] that participation in hard science topics (e.g. AI, Brain Scanning applications) could result in knowledge exchange that empowers autistic people with the skills to critique the role they play in their lives.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

23. **From a neurodiversity-affirmative standpoint, it is essential to recognise that not all may have a formal diagnosis or choose to disclose it.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

24. **This awareness is crucial to understanding autistic participation, as communication needs must be addressed.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

25. **However, when possible, it is important to open up conversations for including others who may self-identify as autistic, and to foster understanding where disclosure of an autism diagnosis may not be desired (as seen in [86]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

26. **However, it is important to consider that including autistic adults who may not desire to disclose their diagnosis may not be feasible in short-term projects where such relationships have not already been established.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

27. **We would like to reinforce that autistic people have multiple lived expertise [59] that can be critical to planning and fostering engagement in participatory activities.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

28. **The research to date suggests that autistic involvement is growing on the research side, and we argue that we could consider their roles as designers, programmers, or other specialists.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

29. **In future projects, there are certainly more possibilities to consider the multiple lived expertise in participatory design and research as recommended by Nicoladis et al. [59].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

30. **An example of this could be learning the interests of stakeholders in drawing, storytelling, coding, and music composition (or as game design students as the case in Connecting through Kinect) and employing these as techniques for knowledge sharing in participatory design activities.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

31. **We understand that this may require researchers to challenge their assumptions on how participatory design could be employed in this context, particularly if their experience is mostly focused on projects where traditional participatory design is concerned (see, e.g. Bannon et al. [6]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

32. **However, we argue that broadening the scope of participation, and reimagining how activities are not only tailored to meet their needs but also strengths, can be beneficial.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

33. **It is often cited that autistic people should have the opportunity to participate in the research process [18, 22, 30, 63, 66].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

34. **Perhaps due to funding barriers or the project scope, there could be challenges in supporting and negotiating participation.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

35. **Tensions can arise, for example, when project timelines are limited, and relationships do not have the resources to develop.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

36. **Nonetheless, it is still important to facilitate conversations surrounding expectations of involvement and provide opportunities for autistic people to negotiate the level of participation that works for them in the project (considering their multiple expertise and identities).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

37. **Where project timelines are restricted, one means is to consider how relationships can be sustained following the project, particularly in cases where establishing the relationship was successful.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

38. **Smaller projects in shorter timelines can provide a test bed for larger projects to develop.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

39. **As researchers in participatory design, one consideration is how our assumptions shape the research process not only in terms of the research direction (e.g. what topic/technology is of focus) but also how we get there (i.e. what tools and techniques are employed throughout the process to foster participation).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

40. **Moreover, we argue that involving autistics in some way falls in line with the considerations of community-based participatory research (see, e.g. [48]) in that more work is needed to document, reflect and challenge assump-tions on decisions made on the design process before the work takes place.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

41. **Reflective processes can make visible research and design assumptions and create a deeper understanding of practice from the stakeholders’ perspective (which, like other community-based participatory research projects, may involve a plurality of practices [48]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

42. **In the case of autism research, we extend the argument to challenge assumptions on what tools and techniques are employed to facilitate participation.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

43. **We encourage researchers to consider reflection activities in collaboration with autistics on the methods employed to foster participation (whether interviews, focus groups, or workshops), and whether those approaches are suitable for com-munication between all stakeholders involved and harness their strengths.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

44. **our proposed opportunities for design can help researchers consider how their project inputs, mechanisms, and effects fall in line with the autistic stakeholders’ strengths, values, and desired outcomes/impacts - meaning that they are leading to more autistic-centred approaches.**
