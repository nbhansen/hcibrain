## Project Overview

An academic research tool for extracting and classifying claims, findings, and methods from HCI papers using LLM-driven analysis. The system focuses on **verbatim extraction** to maintain academic integrity while leveraging LLMs for identification and classification.--

*The HCI Paper Extractor is production-ready for academic research workflows. The system successfully automates literature extraction while maintaining verbatim accuracy and classification precision required for systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses. All core MVP requirements have been achieved and validated.*

**Primary Goal**: Support systematic literature reviews by extracting structured information from 10-50 HCI papers, enabling researchers to identify patterns, gaps, and conflicting claims across literature.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with no external dependencies
- **Application Layer**: CLI interface orchestrating domain operations
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (APIs, environment, file system)
- **Adapters**: Clean abstractions for all external integrations
- **Dependency Inversion**: All dependencies injected via DI container

### 2. Immutable Design Throughout
- All data structures are immutable once created (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`)
- Return new objects instead of modifying existing ones
- Functional programming patterns for data transformations
- Thread-safe by design through immutability
- No mutable default factories (tuples instead of lists)

### 3. Zero Global State
- No global variables or singleton patterns
- All configuration and services injected explicitly
- Dependency injection container manages object lifecycle
- Predictable and testable component interactions
- Complete elimination of side effects

### 4. Domain-Driven Design
- Academic research concepts modeled as first-class domain objects
- Clean separation between business logic and technical concerns
- Domain events for decoupled communication
- Rich domain models with behavior, not just data containers
- Ubiquitous language throughout codebase

### 5. Extensible Foundation
- Abstract LLM interface supports multiple providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Plugin architecture for new export formats
- Easy to add new extraction types or classification schemas
- Provider configuration abstraction for different LLM requirements

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: PDF Processing Foundation
- **Text Extraction**: PyMuPDF for reliable text preservation with page numbers
- **Section Detection**: Regex-based identification of paper sections (Abstract, Methods, Results, etc.)
- **Structured Output**: Return immutable sections with metadata for LLM processing

### Phase 2: LLM Integration
- **Provider Abstraction**: Base class enabling multiple LLM backends
- **Gemini API First**: Start with Gemini 1.5 Flash for cost-effectiveness
- **Structured Prompts**: Section-specific prompts with few-shot examples
- **JSON Output Mode**: Reliable structured responses with low temperature

### Phase 3: Core Pipeline
- **Async Processing**: Handle LLM API calls efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and graceful degradation
- **Progress Tracking**: CLI feedback for batch processing
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity
- **Immutable Pipeline**: Each stage returns new immutable objects

### Phase 4: Export & Usability
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON (complete), CSV (analysis-ready), Markdown (readable)
- **CLI Interface**: Simple commands for single papers and batch processing
- **Integration Ready**: Output formats work with Excel, R, Python pandas

## Development Guiding Principles

### 1. Academic Integrity First
- **Verbatim Extraction**: Never paraphrase or summarize - extract exact text
- **Citation Tracking**: Maintain page numbers and section references
- **Transparency**: Clear confidence scores and evidence classification

### 2. Researcher-Centric Design
- **Literature Review Workflow**: Optimize for systematic review processes
- **Export Compatibility**: Work seamlessly with analysis tools researchers use
- **Manual Synthesis Support**: Provide structured data, don't replace human analysis

### 3. Reliable Automation
- **Deterministic Processing**: Consistent results across runs
- **Error Recovery**: Handle PDF parsing failures and API issues gracefully
- **Validation**: Verify extracted text exists in source documents

### 4. Immutable Data Flow
- **No Side Effects**: Functions return new objects, never modify inputs
- **Predictable State**: Data structures cannot change after creation
- **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe
- **Debugging**: Easier to reason about data flow with immutable objects
- **Testing**: Simpler unit tests with guaranteed object state

## Data Models & Standards
