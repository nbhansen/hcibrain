    avoid: "Routine coding details, standard implementation choices"
    
  results:
    focus: "Empirical findings and artifact performance"
    guidance: |
      Extract specific findings, outcomes, and performance results.
      Look for:
      - User study results and behavioral observations
      - Performance measurements and comparisons
      - Usability findings and interaction patterns
      - Artifact evaluation results
    avoid: "Raw data presentation, routine statistical procedures"
    
  evaluation:
