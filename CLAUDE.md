# HCI Paper Extractor MVP - Development Guide

WE GOT A VENV NEVER FORGET THE VENV

BEFORE STARTING A NEW PHASE, MAKE A DETAILED PLAN AFTER READING CLAUDE.MD AND ENSURE WE FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED

## Project Overview

An academic research tool for extracting and classifying claims, findings, and methods from HCI papers using LLM-driven analysis. The system focuses on **verbatim extraction** to maintain academic integrity while leveraging LLMs for identification and classification.

**Primary Goal**: Support systematic literature reviews by extracting structured information from 10-50 HCI papers, enabling researchers to identify patterns, gaps, and conflicting claims across literature.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
- Each component does one thing well
- Clear separation between PDF processing, LLM analysis, and data storage
- Modular design enables easy testing and maintenance

### 2. Minimal Dependencies
- Use Python standard library where possible
- Add packages only when essential for functionality
- Keep the dependency surface area small for reliability

### 3. Data-First Design
- Focus on getting quality extractions over fancy UI
- Prioritize data integrity and verbatim accuracy
- Export formats optimized for analysis workflows (CSV, JSON)

### 4. Extensible Foundation
- Abstract LLM interface supports multiple providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Plugin architecture for new export formats
- Easy to add new extraction types or classification schemas

### 5. Immutable Design
- All data structures are immutable once created
- Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for all data models
- Return new objects instead of modifying existing ones
- Functional programming patterns for data transformations
- Thread-safe by design through immutability

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: PDF Processing Foundation
- **Text Extraction**: PyMuPDF for reliable text preservation with page numbers
- **Section Detection**: Regex-based identification of paper sections (Abstract, Methods, Results, etc.)
- **Structured Output**: Return immutable sections with metadata for LLM processing

### Phase 2: LLM Integration
- **Provider Abstraction**: Base class enabling multiple LLM backends
- **Gemini API First**: Start with Gemini 1.5 Flash for cost-effectiveness
- **Structured Prompts**: Section-specific prompts with few-shot examples
- **JSON Output Mode**: Reliable structured responses with low temperature

### Phase 3: Core Pipeline
- **Async Processing**: Handle LLM API calls efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and graceful degradation
- **Progress Tracking**: CLI feedback for batch processing
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity
- **Immutable Pipeline**: Each stage returns new immutable objects

### Phase 4: Export & Usability
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON (complete), CSV (analysis-ready), Markdown (readable)
- **CLI Interface**: Simple commands for single papers and batch processing
- **Integration Ready**: Output formats work with Excel, R, Python pandas

## Development Guiding Principles

### 1. Academic Integrity First
- **Verbatim Extraction**: Never paraphrase or summarize - extract exact text
- **Citation Tracking**: Maintain page numbers and section references
- **Transparency**: Clear confidence scores and evidence classification

### 2. Researcher-Centric Design
- **Literature Review Workflow**: Optimize for systematic review processes
- **Export Compatibility**: Work seamlessly with analysis tools researchers use
- **Manual Synthesis Support**: Provide structured data, don't replace human analysis

### 3. Reliable Automation
- **Deterministic Processing**: Consistent results across runs
- **Error Recovery**: Handle PDF parsing failures and API issues gracefully
- **Validation**: Verify extracted text exists in source documents

### 4. Scientific Rigor
- **Classification Accuracy**: >90% precision for element type identification
- **Statistical Data Capture**: Reliable extraction of p-values, sample sizes, effect sizes
- **Evidence Typing**: Distinguish quantitative, qualitative, and theoretical claims

### 5. Scalable Architecture
- **Batch Processing**: Handle 10-50 papers efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Process large documents without memory issues
- **API Rate Limiting**: Respect LLM provider limits with intelligent backoff

### 6. Immutable Data Flow
- **No Side Effects**: Functions return new objects, never modify inputs
- **Predictable State**: Data structures cannot change after creation
- **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe
- **Debugging**: Easier to reason about data flow with immutable objects
- **Testing**: Simpler unit tests with guaranteed object state

## Data Models & Standards

### Core Entities (All Immutable)
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Paper:
    paper_id: str
    title: str
    authors: tuple[str, ...]  # Immutable sequence
    venue: Optional[str] = None
    year: Optional[int] = None
    doi: Optional[str] = None
    file_path: str = ""

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExtractedElement:
    element_id: str
    paper_id: str
    element_type: Literal["claim", "finding", "method", "artifact"]
    text: str
    section: str
    confidence: float
    evidence_type: Literal["quantitative", "qualitative", "theoretical", "unknown"]
    page_number: Optional[int] = None
```

### Classification Schema
- **Element Types**: claim, finding, method, artifact
- **Evidence Types**: quantitative, qualitative, theoretical, mixed, unknown
- **Confidence Scores**: 0.0-1.0 for extraction quality assessment

### Storage Strategy
- **JSON per Paper**: Human-readable, version-controllable individual results
- **Aggregated Exports**: Combined datasets for cross-paper analysis
- **UUID Tracking**: Unique identifiers for all entities
- **Immutable Persistence**: Write-once, read-many storage pattern

## Quality Assurance

### Extraction Validation
- Verbatim accuracy: 100% (extracted text must exist verbatim in source)
- Element classification: >90% precision based on manual validation
- Statistical data accuracy: Reliable p-value and sample size extraction

### Performance Targets
- Processing speed: <30 seconds per paper
- API efficiency: Minimal token usage with section-based processing
- Export compatibility: Works with Excel, R, Python analysis workflows

## Development Environment

### Virtual Environment (Required)
**Always use a virtual environment** for this project to ensure dependency isolation and reproducible builds.

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify you're in the virtual environment
which python  # Should show path to venv/bin/python
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Setup (after activating virtual environment)
pip install -e .
pip install PyYAML  # Required for prompt management
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Core operations (ALL IMPLEMENTED ✅)
python -m hci_extractor extract paper.pdf --output results.json
python -m hci_extractor batch input_dir/ output_dir/ --max-concurrent 3
python -m hci_extractor export output_dir/ --format csv --output analysis.csv
python -m hci_extractor validate paper.pdf
