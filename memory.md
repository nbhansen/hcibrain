  - Security (S), Complexity (C90), Bugbear (B), and many more
  - Max complexity set to 10
  - Per-file ignores for tests and scripts
  - Temporarily ignoring docs and annotations for gradual adoption

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - Ruff with auto-fix
  - Black formatting
  - MyPy type checking with strict mode
  - Bandit security scanning

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Created `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
  - Comprehensive quality checks on push/PR
  - Quality gates that fail builds on critical issues
  - Codecov integration for coverage tracking
  - Complexity thresholds and security scanning

### Development Tools Added
- **Code Quality Dependencies**: Added to pyproject.toml dev dependencies
  - bandit (security)
  - radon (complexity metrics)
  - vulture (dead code detection)

- **Baseline Analysis Script**: Created `scripts/code_quality_baseline.py`
  - Comprehensive metrics collection
  - JSON report generation
  - Statistics summary

## 📊 BASELINE METRICS ESTABLISHED

### Current State (Before Refactoring)
- **Total Python files**: 56
- **Total lines of code**: 13,748
- **Code smell issues**: 925 (detected by enhanced ruff)
- **Dead code items**: 25
- **Largest files** (potential God Objects):
  - `commands.py`: 2,651 lines ⚠️ CRITICAL
  - `json_recovery.py`: 981 lines
  - `section_processor.py`: 908 lines
  - `error_classifier.py`: 729 lines
  - `simple_extractor.py`: 579 lines

### Top Code Smell Categories Found
1. **COM812**: Missing trailing comma (359 occurrences)
2. **TRY003**: Raise vanilla args (93 occurrences)
3. **W293**: Blank line with whitespace (68 occurrences)
4. **ARG002**: Unused method argument (43 occurrences)
5. **B904**: Raise without from inside except (30 occurrences)

### Critical Issues Identified

- **Current Metrics**: 1,157 code smells, 2 security issues, 30 dead code items

## ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 2 - Large File Refactoring

### Commands.py Decomposition (Successfully completed!)
1. **✅ Created command module structure**:
   ```
   src/hci_extractor/cli/command_modules/
   ├── processing_commands.py    # Extract, batch, parse, validate commands
   ├── export_utils.py           # Shared export utilities (CSV, JSON, MD)
   └── __init__.py              # Module exports
   ```

2. **✅ Successfully Extracted Core Commands**:
   - **extract command**: 359 lines → modularized ✅
   - **batch command**: 397 lines → modularized ✅ 
   - **parse command**: 100 lines → modularized ✅
   - **validate command**: 83 lines → modularized ✅

3. **✅ Preserved Functionality**: All commands work identically
4. **✅ Applied "Wrap, Don't Rewrite" Principle**: Zero functional changes

### File Size Reduction Achieved:
- **Before**: commands.py = 2,651 lines (MASSIVE God Object)
- **After**: commands.py = 1,728 lines (35% reduction)
- **New modules**: processing_commands.py = 1,125 lines
- **Net benefit**: Improved maintainability, clearer separation of concerns

### Architectural Improvements:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Processing logic isolated from other commands
- **Reusability**: Export utilities can be shared across commands
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual commands
- **Testing**: Individual command modules can be tested in isolation

### Other Large Files to Review
- Consider splitting json_recovery.py (981 lines)
- Review section_processor.py (908 lines) complexity
- Analyze error_classifier.py (729 lines) for SRP violations

## 🎯 PHASE 3 PLAN: Python-Specific Smell Fixes

### Exception Handling (B904 - 30 occurrences)
- Replace generic `except Exception` with specific types
- Add proper `raise ... from err` chains
- Improve error context and logging

### Async Anti-patterns (Web Module)
- Fix fire-and-forget async tasks (RUF006)
- Add proper async context managers
