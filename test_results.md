   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

5. **The generation of keywords for our search involved careful discussion between the two authors and an independent reviewer (recommended by the Joanna Briggs approach [65]).**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

6. **We adapted keywords based on venue themes.**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

7. **So, in technology development venues, we used only autism-specific keywords (with wildcards (*) where appropriate).**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

8. **In the venues dedicated to autism research, our keyword searches focused on participation in the design process (Table 2).**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

9. **To obtain these keywords, one author created a Python script that counted keyword frequency from the corpus after the phase 1 filtering removed irrelevant papers (e.g., false positives, duplicates, or concerning children).**
   - *Section:* methodology
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

   - *Section:* abstract
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

3. **The projects involved autistic adults in different ways to share their expertise on topics and the project direction.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

5. **Five projects concentrated on the involvement of autistic adults in shaping the understanding of the project topic (AHAT, Inclusive Online Dating, AccessASD, PIUMA, Reimagining Social Media).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

6. **These projects were driven by methodological approaches intended to understand the perspective of autistic adults and draw on their expertise on the topic, whether through customised participatory methodologies (AccessASD, AHAT) or with a philosophy of understanding the topic from the perspective of autistic adults (e.g., by embedding approaches that focus on lived experience (PIUMA)) or intending to understand a particular topic from the autistic perspective (Reimagining Social Media).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

7. **In Connecting through Kinect, autistic partners were valued for their expertise in game design, which was harnessed in the design process.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

8. **This suggests that the autistic perspective as a way of experiencing the world is valued across projects.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

9. **It is important to note that the level of participation differed between the projects.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

10. **However, it is not clear how decisions surrounding participation were made, which merits reflection.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

11. **Literature indicates that autistic stakeholders may not want to participate fully [56].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

12. **Moreover, experience adopting participatory design should be considered, particularly for researchers and stakeholders who are employing it for the first time in autism research [22].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

13. **In other cases, as we have seen in Connecting through Kinect, it may not be possible to directly include the target stakeholders.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

14. **In these cases, there was a known importance for having some autistic representation (e.g., autistic researchers or autistic allies).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

15. **There is an important consideration in understanding what knowledge those stakeholders have and what assumptions they may bring to the process based on their lived experience [30, 59].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

16. **Building infrastructures to support participation varied between projects, such as devising customised participatory approaches (e.g. AHAT and AccessASD) or (as in most cases) providing multiple modes of participation (Reimagining Social Media, Inclusive Online Dating).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

17. **Conencting through Kinect employed this quite creatively by encouraging movement in the design process, which was directly tailored to autistic needs.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

18. **We learn that the conflicting sensory needs of autistic people need to be considered particularly in group activities (e.g., in PIUMA and Biomusic).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

19. **All people, but especially autistic people, report differences in how they process sensory information, such as sounds [13].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

20. **Some people have low thresholds, meaning they are highly sensitive to the stimulus and desire to avoid them.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

21. **Others may have a high threshold and actively seek certain sensory stimuli.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

22. **These differences can cause tension and power imbalance, particularly in cases where it may seem that one stakeholder’s needs are prioritised over another.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

23. **Power dynamics played a nuanced role in facilitating conversations between autistic and non-autistic stakeholders [57, 59].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

24. **Three of the projects (AccessASD, AHAT, and Reimagining Social Media) mentioned having autistic researchers on the team, who were imperative for making decisions on the project direction and making connections with other autistic stakeholders, which has been recommended as a means for empowering autistic participation [62].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

25. **How activities were structured seemed to be important to ensure that participants had a voice.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

26. **Some projects approached this by ensuring that autistic stakeholders had an opportunity to share ideas individually before engaging in group activities (e.g., in AccessASD and SocialMirror), while others facilitated turn-taking (e.g., in PIUMA).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

27. **However, while these researchers have done great work, we also witnessed limited engagement of the autistic adult stakeholders in shaping and refining the approaches employed for participation.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

28. **The introduction of individual activities before group activities occurred was important in AccessASD and SocialMirror.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

29. **The level of participatory relationships varied between projects.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

30. **However, few initiated from long-lasting relationships, with most focusing on a shorter period of time.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

31. **This is not surprising, given the limited resources available to support neurodiversity-affirmative research in autism [66].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

32. **As mentioned above, most funding typically covers a shorter time period with actionable deadlines, which may be in contrast to the long-term commitment of participatory design.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

33. **In conclusion, the projects examined showed diverse ways of involving autistic adults in design, from tailored methodologies to providing multiple modes to participate in specific design activities.**
   - *Section:* conclusion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

34. **Through the lens of Program Theory, we shed light on how participatory design activities unfolded and the opportunities for further involvement.**
   - *Section:* conclusion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

35. **We believe this was a valuable means for understanding how participation was mapped throughout the process of all projects: it drew attention to who was involved, how activities were structured to foster participation, and the long-lasting effects of the process.**
   - *Section:* conclusion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

36. **It also revealed discussions that require attention (e.g. decision-making in participation).**
   - *Section:* conclusion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

   - *Section:* introduction
   - *Evidence Type:* unknown
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

2. **There has been increasing interest in supporting autistic adults with technology (for example, at home [68, 87] or at work [35, 82]).**
   - *Section:* introduction
   - *Evidence Type:* unknown
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

3. **a growing concern relates to 1In this article, we use identity-first language (i.e. autistic adult) rather than person-first language (i.e. person with autism), as this has been the preference of the autistic community [84].**
   - *Section:* introduction
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

4. **Autism research has been framed in three ways.**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

5. **One perspective views the autistic person as having problems that need to be fixed.**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

6. **Infamously, the medical model positions autism as a “deficit” with traits that need to be cured [3].**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

7. **For instance, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is often referred to when diagnosing autism [5]; the diagnostic criteria positions autistic traits as impairments, notably in social relationships, motor movements, and executive functioning.**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

8. **Moreover, the theory of mind positions autistic people as unable to understand the mental states of themselves and others [7].**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

9. **Autistic people have been characterised as having difficulties seeing the “bigger picture” due to their tendencies to focus on details [34].**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

10. **While many autistic people need support in daily life, framing the problem from within the autistic person has been seen as harmful; it promotes a perception that autistic people must change their behaviour and adapt to the context [16, 54, 80].**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

11. **Thus, they have been contested by autistic advocates because they assume that there is an ideal mind to be attained [43, 45, 80].**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

12. **Many autistic people engage in self-stimulatory movements, such as hand rocking and fidgeting, that help regulate emotions [46].**
   - *Section:* related_work
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

13. **We argue that more work is needed to reflect on decision-making on who participates, as well as assumptions that may influence those decisions.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

14. **It is important to consider how the nuances of how autistic stakeholders experience the world can be factored in designing activities, particularly in cases where there may be conflicts in sensory needs, such as in group activities (as referenced by Maun et al. [52]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

15. **Just as autistic adults are experts on what tools and technologies would benefit their lives, they are also experts on what methods and approaches could engage and drive them to participate.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

16. **Therefore, we believe there could be more opportunities to involve autistic people in the decision-making of methods employed through active reflection, as we will discuss in section 6.2.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

17. **Additionally, the projects demonstrated that balancing power is a principle that should be considered when evaluating how the project unfolds.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

18. **Although balancing such power is generally important in participatory projects [41, 76], the reflections on why this was facilitated seemed to stem from a consideration toward the voice of autistics in design and keeping the process autistic-centred.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

19. **Creating lasting impact is a key issue facing much of HCI research that engages communities (see e.g. [23, 42]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

20. **The shorter-term projects seemed to gather positive relationship-building experiences, particularly through partnerships with autism organisations and charities.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

21. **Such approaches enable shorter-term projects to connect with existing infrastructures within the community where there are predefined relationships with autistic people, and their role in society, thus mirroring existing developments in PD [23].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

22. **As researchers, we should connect with autistic-led organisations if the mechanism is to respect the autistic experience [31].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

23. **Embedding this research into the community enables “infrastructuring” [47], strengthening existing positive efforts by embedding them into the fabric of what is already there, strengthening impact, and increasing the possibility of long-term engagements.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

24. **In saying that, we argue the need to make visible the immediate gains that autistic people can harness through participation (which is important in community-based participatory design [48]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

25. **Doing so will also need to consider the plurality of goals between autistic stakeholders and organisational objectives, and how they align with the communities where participation is sought [48].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

26. **It is important to acknowledge that resources and funding may impact who is involved and how participation is facilitated.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* qualitative
   - *Confidence:* 0.95

27. **We suggest that more participatory design projects could include autistic people in conversations about the role AI (e.g. Large Language Models employed in chatbots/agents, or deep learning techniques employed for autism diagnosis) could play in their lives.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

28. **Additionally, we suggest conducting participatory research with autistic people to explore what the diagnostic process could look like and how technology could support that process.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

29. **With the growing recognition of self-diagnosis in neurodiversity-affirmative research (e.g., as indicated by Sarrett[73]), we recommend involving those who self-identify as autistic and how their needs could be facilitated in the diagnosis process, if at all.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

30. **We agree with Fletcher-Watson et al. [30] that participation in hard science topics (e.g. AI, Brain Scanning applications) could result in knowledge exchange that empowers autistic people with the skills to critique the role they play in their lives.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

31. **We would like to reinforce that autistic people have multiple lived expertise [59] that can be critical to planning and fostering engagement in participatory activities.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

32. **In future projects, there are certainly more possibilities to consider the multiple lived expertise in participatory design and research as recommended by Nicoladis et al. [59].**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

33. **However, we argue that broadening the scope of participation, and reimagining how activities are not only tailored to meet their needs but also strengths, can be beneficial.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

34. **Moreover, we argue that involving autistics in some way falls in line with the considerations of community-based participatory research (see, e.g. [48]) in that more work is needed to document, reflect and challenge assumptions on decisions made on the design process before the work takes place.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.80

35. **Reflective processes can make visible research and design assumptions and create a deeper understanding of practice from the stakeholders’ perspective (which, like other community-based participatory research projects, may involve a plurality of practices [48]).**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.85

36. **We encourage researchers to consider reflection activities in collaboration with autistics on the methods employed to foster participation (whether interviews, focus groups, or workshops), and whether those approaches are suitable for communication between all stakeholders involved and harness their strengths.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

37. **Our analysis suggests that there is not a “one size fits all” solution, but rather an approach that is revisited and refined for future work following reflections between autistic and non-autistic stakeholders.**
   - *Section:* discussion
   - *Evidence Type:* mixed
   - *Confidence:* 0.90

38. **our proposed opportunities for design can help researchers consider how their project inputs, mechanisms, and effects fall in line with the autistic stakeholders’ strengths, values, and desired outcomes/impacts - meaning that they are leading to more autistic-centred approaches.**
   - *Section:* conclusion
   - *Evidence Type:* theoretical
   - *Confidence:* 0.95
